📌 My First and Worst Project Ever
Here lies my first and worst project ever—a testament to how far I've come.

🚀 A reminder that every expert was once a beginner.

Why does this exist?
To embrace the journey.
To cringe at my past mistakes.
To never forget where I started.
Should you look at this?
No. But if you do, prepare for spaghetti code 🍝 and questionable decisions.
